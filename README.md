An online job portal is a web-based platform that allows job seekers to search and apply for job 
opportunities, and employers to post job openings and manage the recruitment process. 

The Online Job Portal project aims to develop a user-friendly and intuitive online platform that 
allows job seekers to search for job opportunities based on various criteria such as job title, 
location, salary, and experience level.

Employers can post job openings and manage their job postings, review resumes, communicate 
with candidates, and track job applications. 

The main goal of this project is to create an efficient and convenient platform that makes the job 
search process easier for job seekers and the recruitment process simpler and more effective for 
employers. 
This project can benefit job seekers by providing them with access to a wide range of job 
opportunities from various industries, while employers can find qualified candidates quickly and 
easily, helping to reduce the time and cost involved in the recruitment process.
